# Assembler

This is a very simple assembler I wrote in python designed to work for my 8 bit computer wired in logicly.
It has an extremely limited instruction set with only 7 used commands for a total of 8: LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, BRA, BRZ and HLT.
It has a 3 bit opcode, and a 5 bit operand for 32 memory addresses for both instructions and data.
It uses only direct addressing.
The output is plain text designed to ease input into the computer
